Hey there! 👋 

A code-crafting wizard 🧙‍♂️ currently casting spells (and fixing bugs) at Trendyol as a Senior Software Engineer. When I'm not battling with production issues or taming wild microservices, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends and building cool stuff.

💻 By day, I architect scalable solutions and write clean code.
🌙 By night, I experiment with modern web technologies and contribute to open source.
🚀 Always excited about learning new things and pushing boundaries.

Think of me as your friendly neighborhood developer who's passionate about:

<ul class="passion-list">
  <li>Building robust and scalable systems that stand the test of time</li>
  <li>Crafting elegant user experiences that make people smile</li>
  <li>Contributing to the web ecosystem, one line of code at a time</li>
</ul>

👶 When I'm not coding, I'm enjoying precious moments with my newborn son, Kerem, who's teaching me a whole new kind of debugging - parenting! Currently based in Bursa, but my roots trace back to the beautiful Manisa-İzmir region of Turkey.

Let's build something awesome together! 🤝
